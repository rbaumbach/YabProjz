# Quotes

This is a simple exercise of displaying quotes from a [Quotes API](https://zenquotes.io) in a `UITableView` with dynamic `UITableViewCell` text sizing.

## Challenge Introduction

I was given 25 minutes[^1] to build an iOS app from scratch using any resource necessary to achieve the exercise goals described above.  I was given two URLs:

1. [Quote API documentation](https://docs.zenquotes.io/zenquotes-documentation/)
2. A sample JSON response that was "minified" and required a tool like "JSONPretty" to digest.

The completed code can be found in the [OnTheFly](OnTheFly/) directory of this repo.

## Challege Thoughts

TBD

## Challenge Discussion

I was able to complete everything except the dynamic text within the time limit.  I was currently in the process of remembering the technique for basic dymamic `UITableViewCell.textLabel?.text` when I ran out of time.

## Hindsight Execution

TBD

The completed code can be found in the [Hindsight](Hindsight/) directory of this repo.

## Final Thoughts

TBD

[^1]: The exercise itself was 30 minutes.  However, this challenge was a surprise and wasn't communicated to me and my workstation wasn't setup.  I spent about ~5 minutes getting Xcode ready for development.
