# 6. Implement sorting on images

## Description

As a user, after searching for images, I'm able to sort them by time (default), "viralness" and top results.

## Additional Notes

1. The current limit on a single Imgur gallery API looks to be about ~75 items.
2. There is only a limit on the amount of images only if there is a reasonable amount of items being returned form the api. Ex: If a search only returns 15 gallery items.
3. The app should be updated to leverage the "paging" Imgur API to continously fetch more gallery items as a user scrolls.

## Point Value: 1

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A when an image is selected in the image view, a modal is presented to the user that displays the image selected in full view.
