# Mobile Coding Challenge

## Goal

Build an app that allows the user to search and view images

## Time limit

Please send submission by end of day and do not spend significantly more than 4 hours in total.

## Description
Jon is researching the perfect image for a hyperloop shuttle. He enters his keyword in a search field. The app connects to an image search API (e.g. Imgur) and displays the result associated with his research in a tasteful manner. He can then scroll over the results and click on individual images to bring them in full screen for a great viewing experience.

## Instructions

Treat this challenge as if you were part of the team. Feel free to ask questions if you are completely stuck or use any of your favorite resources such as 3rd party sdks/libraries, Google, Stack Overflow etc.
Additionally, anything that makes the app fast, effortless and delightful. Imagine that you are delivering a consumer facing feature.
